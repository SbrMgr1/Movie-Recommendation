docker ps -a                               --> to see all containers in docker
docker ps                                  --> to see only running containers in docker
docker stop $(docker ps)                   --> to stop running containers in docker. Why we do not use "docker stop $(docker ps -a)"?
docker rm $(docker ps -a)                  --> to remove all containers from docker
docker rm -force containerId               --> to remove specific container
docker run -it -p 8085:8080 --rm imageName --> it makes a container to run specified Image.
										        Note: container will be created only when we run our image.

If we delete all containers then images are still there in the docker. Why? see docker architecture image
docker images                              --> to see all images in docker
docker rmi imageId                         --> to delete specific image
										       Note: image may be using by container. so to delete image we have to delete container who is using the image      and then we can delete image.
										       Second Note: container may be running as well. So in this case we must stop container first then delete
docker build -t imageName . --rm           --> to create image of the project
docker run -it imageName sh                --> to see image contains. 
										       Note: It is necessary to see wheather our files and folder is copied properly or not in working directory
exit                                       --> to exit from looking image contains
